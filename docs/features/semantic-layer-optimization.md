# Semantic Layer Optimization

The semantic layer is a crucial component of Data Neuron that bridges the gap between natural language queries and your database schema. Optimizing this layer can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of your queries.

## Importance of Semantic Layer Optimization

A well-optimized semantic layer:

- Improves query accuracy
- Enhances natural language understanding
- Reduces ambiguity in entity recognition
- Speeds up query processing

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose clear, descriptive names for tables and columns in your semantic layer.

2. **Add Aliases**: Provide common aliases or alternative names for entities to improve query interpretation.

3. **Include Business Definitions**: Add detailed business definitions for tables and columns to enhance context.

4. **Define Relationships**: Clearly specify relationships between tables to enable more complex queries.

5. **Optimize for Common Queries**: Tailor your semantic layer to support frequently asked questions.

## Example Optimization

Here's an example of an optimized semantic layer definition:

```yaml
tables:
  - name: sales
    description: "Record of all sales transactions"
    aliases: ["transactions", "orders"]
    columns:
      - name: sale_date
        description: "Date of the sale"
        aliases: ["transaction_date", "order_date"]
      - name: customer_id
        description: "Unique identifier for the customer"
        relationships:
          - table: customers
            column: id

definitions:
  - term: "revenue"
    definition: "The total amount of money earned from sales"
    calculation: "SUM(sales.amount)"
```

## Optimization Process

1. **Analyze Current Queries**: Review common queries to identify frequently used terms and concepts.

2. **Map Business Terminology**: Align your semantic layer with the business terminology used in your organization.

3. **Iterate and Test**: Continuously refine your semantic layer based on query performance and user feedback.

4. **Use Data Neuron CLI**: Utilize the Data Neuron CLI to manage and update your semantic layer:

   ```bash
   dnn --update-context your_context_name
   ```

5. **Version Control**: Keep your semantic layer definitions in version control to track changes and collaborate with team members.
